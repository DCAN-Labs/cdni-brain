# Best Coding Practices

We at DCAN Labs highly value creating code and workflows that are able to be reused and shared with other institutions. This means that we should be following best practices in order to make it easy for someone outside of our lab to use and understand our code. 

## NMNIND Workflow

When code is developed without keeping best practices and standards in mind, challenges can arise when someone who didn't develop the code tries to use it. Some challenges that can come out of this is that the code if not fully developed/bullet-proofed, it has poor documentation, there are hard-coded paths, and it's overall not designed to be reused.

In an ideal world, code should be:

* Fully documented

* Include descriptions and examples

* Able to run on any platform

* Modularized, with modular elements able to be reused

* Containerized at its final stage

In order to try to fit into this ideal world, we try to follow the NMIND coding standard when developing code. A checklist of what the NMIND standards are can be found [here](https://www.nmind.org/standards-checklist/)
