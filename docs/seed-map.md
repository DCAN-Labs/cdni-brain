# Seed Map Parcellation Wrapper

Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) is one of the most common ways to explore functional connectivity within the brain. Based on the time series of a seed voxel (or collection of voxels, often called a region of interest [ROI]), connectivity is calculated as the correlation of time series for all other voxels in the brain. The result of Seed based correlation is a connectivity map showing Pearson correlation for each voxel indicating how well its time series correlates with the time series of the seed.
