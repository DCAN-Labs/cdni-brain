## Best Practices

[NMIND](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01647-0) is a great place to start for exposure to best coding practices in the neuroimaging field. Below I have listed some common best practices within our lab.

### Logging Codebase Changes
**Record Change Dates**
- The following is an example of how to do this:
```
author: Audrey Houghton
created on: 11/25/2023
last modified: 11/30/2023
by whom: Audrey Houghton
```
**Commit Often**
- Make sure that you are regularly pushing your changes to a branch on GitHub with concise but descriptive commit messages.

### Error / Out Logging
- The more descriptive you can make your codebase's logs, the better.

### Commenting
- At the top of each script within a given repository, describe what that script is doing.
- At the beginning of each function, define the purpose of the function, what its inputs are, and what its outputs are.
