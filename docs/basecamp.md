# Basecamp

## Adding a New Project to the [DCAN Labs Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/5032058/)

Aside from personal project boards and teams, all research projects associated with a PI must be assigned a project number and be tracked on a new Basecamp Project board. If you have questions about where on Basecamp something should be tracked or whether a new Basecamp Project board is needed or not, please reach out to the DCAN project managers directly for guidance. In order to obtain a project number and set up a Basecamp, please do the following:

**Step 1: Request a project number from the project managers**

Fill out the [Project Request Form](https://forms.gle/1ddNGf6pbe5WE2QV8) to request a project number. Please consult the list of [current active projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZYwQIaH2aJP3ClCwHZL6pmaTSNGbAkg91co2ENcIYl0/edit?usp=sharing) to make sure that your project name is distinct. The PMs will also confirm that the project name and goals are distinct from exisiting projects.   

**Step 2: Create a new project on Basecamp utilizing the template**
 - Go to the Basecamp dashboard and select **Make a New Project** at the top of the page
 - Select **Choose a project template**
   
   ![choose_a_project_template](img/choose_a_project_template.png)

 - Select **S1XXX - Study Template** under **Choose a project template**
   
    ![select_study_template](img/select_study_template.png)

 - Fill out the necessary information. Under **Name this Project**, make sure to include the assigned project number and use the project name approved by the PMs (if you decide you want to change it later, that's ok, just make sure to loop in the PMs so that we can adjust our tracking sheets), eg: **S1010: CABINET Development**

**Step 3: Complete set up once Basecamp is created**

 - Add all necessary people to the project
 - Fill out the **Project Overview** under **Docs & Files**
