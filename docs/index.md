## About Us

Our work focuses on advancing the understanding of brain development in health and disease. We are an interdisciplinary team of researchers trying to understand the basic principles of how the brain works across development, learn how brain-based disorders develop and progress across time, and engage underrepresented communities in academic medicine and research.

Our lab members have diverse training backgrounds and areas of expertise spanning the fields of neuroscience, developmental and clinical psychology, psychiatry, biomedical engineering, and computer science.

You can find out more information about the lab on our [website](https://innovation.umn.edu/developmental-cognition-and-neuroimaging-lab/).
