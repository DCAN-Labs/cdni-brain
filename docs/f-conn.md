# F Conn Regression

**fconn anova** is a package designed to identify differences in functional connectivity between groups using a repeated measures anova. By default, the package uses all the data to test for differences in connectivity for groups, groups and networks and connections. Then, it creates post-hoc tables. This package also does a plan B test, where a series of repeated measures anova are run for each functional network pair. It works in cross-sectional and longitudinal samples.
