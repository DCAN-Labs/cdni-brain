# How to Install Programs on a UMN Computer 

For downloading new programs, you will need to request admin access from the OIT Help Desk at 612-301-4357. 

Explain that you are trying to install a particular software/application and ask for admin privileges. Theyâ€™ll go through an identity verification process with you and then generate a temporary password that works for 24 hours. 

Username: .\useradmin	Password: auto generated each time

Note: Due to the identity verification requirement, you cannot request these privileges through an emailed help ticket. You have to call them.
