# Brain Wide Association Studies (BWAS)

BWAS are used to link brain structure and function to behavior. It uses massive univariate models that are fit to relate functional connectivity to behavior. These models are combined to estimate the beta-weights of the BWAS. The resulting models are then selectively combined to estimate "behavioral" risk scores in individuals (the PolyNeuro Risk Score).
