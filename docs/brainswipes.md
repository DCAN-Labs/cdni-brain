# BrainSwipes
[BrainSwipes](https://brainswipes.us) is a web application that brings the swipe right, swipe left paradigm to quality assurance. 

## Account Setup

Getting set up on BrainSwipes only takes a few steps:

1. Create an account with your UMN/institutional email.

2. Complete the necessary tutorials to swipe on a study. These are generally the Introduction to BrainSwipes, Surface Delineation, Atlas Registration, Functional Registration, and processedPractice. Some studies require more/different tutorials, which will be listed when you select a dataset to swipe on.

3. Once you complete the required tutorials, you should be able to immediately swipe on the public studies (BCP, ABIDE, HBN).

4. For studies with restricted access, you'll need to request access to them. This can be done by clicking the study, which should take you to an About page for the study, with a `Request Access to STUDY` button on the bottom of the page. Fill out the form and wait for your access to be approved/denied. We try to send out emails when we review access requests but this is not a guarantee. If you are having trouble getting access request, please fill out our [BrainSwipes Access Issue form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLUOPkuKYdhYRZ8nJG4kQkhhyaZ_YEFtHops8p2fu_-zOYiA/viewform). When you get access, you'll need to sign in with Globus to verify your identity before beginning to swipe.

## Additional Resources 

If you are a member of the CDNI Slack, we have a channel called swipes-visuall-qc, which is a channel for posting questions about swiping. If you see an image and aren't sure how to rate it or are unsure if something is a concern, you can screenshot the image and post it there to get more feedback. 

We also have weekly office hours, hosted on Zoom and in person at MIDB, where people can come to swipe together and get feedback. If you would like to be added to that invite, contact rae McCollum (mccol199@umn.edu).
