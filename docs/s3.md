# S3

Read: [s3cmd usage page](https://s3tools.org/usage)


s3 is the tier2 storage system DCAN uses mostly for storing large datasets. Each user has 120 TB of space, which is why it is preferred to store data here as opposed to tier 1. For a comprehensive introduction to s3, see [this tutorial video](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oz3i5lbld5VmXGdhWagOMWYOIJmgrJA4) (recorded as part of the Data Processing Workshop hosted for undergraduate research assistants). It is encouraged to watch this tutorial prior to your first time using s3 commands. Note that after you run workbench commands, make sure to `module rm workbench` prior to doing any `s3cmd` commands.


## s3 Basic Commands

18. Setting up the bucket and basic commands:

    - To make a new bucket, use: `s3cmd mb s3://bucket-name/`

        - **NOTE:** You are no longer allowed to have to an underscore or uppercase letter in your bucket name. MSI might still let you create a bucket with an uppercase, but it can cause issues with other programs that interact with s3 buckets. 

    - To see what is inside the bucket, use: `s3cmd ls s3://bucket-name/`

    - To add a file to the bucket, use: `s3cmd sync path/to/directory s3://bucket-name/`

        - If trying to upload data to an s3 bucket, make sure to first grab an [srun interactive job](slurm_params.md)

    - To remove a file in a bucket, use `s3cmd rm s3://bucket-name/ --recursive` 

    - To remove a bucket, use `s3cmd rb s3://bucket-name/ --recursive` 

    - To sync a file from your s3 bucket, use: `s3cmd sync s3://bucket-name/file_name /path/to/where/you/want/the/directory/to/go/`

    - To add a directory to the bucket, use: `s3cmd sync --recursive dir_name s3://bucket-name/ `

        - If your job runs out of time before the data upload is complete, use `s3cmd sync --recursive --no-check-md5` to restart the upload process where it left off and assure 
        everything makes it. Run this even if the sync says complete to validate

        - If you're re-running a pipeline/process and you only want the new outputs to be in the directory that you're syncing to, include the `--delete-removed` flag to your sync command. This will remove files that are present in the destination path but aren't present in the source path.

    - To check the size of a single bucket: `s3cmd du -H s3://bucket-name/`

        - This process can take awhile and an srun will most likely be needed

    - To understand how much of your individual s3 quota you have used (each person in the lab is allocated 120TB of s3 space): `s3info -u x500`

    - For more s3 command usage, see [here](https://s3tools.org/usage).

## Setting a policy on s3   

78. Setting an S3 policy on MSI:

    - Must use this path for your `~/.bashrc` to be able to use the set_s3policy command: `export PATH=/home/dhp/public/storage/s3policy_bin/:$PATH`

        To open your `~/.bashrc` and modify it, use `emacs ~/.bashrc &`

    - To check who already has access to the bucket, run: `/home/faird/shared/code/internal/utilities/MSI-utilities/s3_get_x500/get_x500.sh s3://bucket_name/`

        - Note that this won't include you, so don't forget to include yourself, especially if it isn't your bucket (you can revoke your own access).

        - The DCAN google drive has a Lab Data Locations sheet with the locations and owners of s3 buckets

    - Then use this command to set the s3 policy: `set_s3policy x500_1,x500_2,etc bucket_name FULL`. The bucket name does not need to have the s3:// prefix in this command 

    - **IMPORTANT: every time you set a policy you need to list EVERYONE that needs access. You CANNOT just list that one person's x500 or only that one person will have access to the bucket! (Along with the bucket owner)**

20. Instructions to the manual method of setting an s3 policy on MSI can be found at [this link](https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-use-s3-buckets-share-data-tier-2-storage-other-users). An example policy file that gives full access to the s3 bucket  “bucket_name” is as follows:

## Setting up a .s3cfg

79. Setting up a .s3cfg file: 

    - Open a new terminal in MSI and create a file named .s3cfg-RANDOM in your home directory

        * Can't just be .s3cfg, name it something identifiable 

    - Run `s3cmd -c ~/.s3cfg-RANDOM --configure` and provide your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key when prompted

    - You shouldn't have to make any changes to the file unless the s3 bucket is hosted by something different than *s3.amazonaws.com*
